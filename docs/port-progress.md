# i386 port progress

The full objective and acceptance gates remain in `PLAN.md`. The standalone
32-bit TempleOS environment is not yet implemented.

## Bootstrap evidence

`python3 tools/test-rebuild.py` packages an isolated test ISO, builds the compiler
and kernel inside the x86-64 guest, exports their uncompressed binaries via QMP,
boots those binaries, and rebuilds them again. Host tools package and transport
bytes; HolyC compilation occurs in TempleOS. The desktop image, archived binaries,
and user's writable disk are not modified by this test.

Two such generations have run successfully. In the initial run, exported sizes were 193,792 bytes for
the compiler and 189,760 for the kernel. The generations are not byte-identical:
the initial run found 22 differing compiler bytes and 67 differing kernel bytes.
The kernel has an embedded compilation timestamp, but differences beyond that
remain unexplained. This proves a rebuild/reboot cycle, not a reproducible-build
fixed point or complete M0 acceptance. Run manifests record hashes and differences
under `build/rebuild-test/result.json`.

Persistence, audio, multicore validation, 386 emulator profile selection, and
further source/binary difference analysis remain outstanding for M0.

## Initial i386 backend

`Compiler/I386/Expr.HC` uses the existing HolyC lexer/parser and consumes its IR.
It emits 386 integer instructions with a pair-of-dwords evaluation stack and
EDX:EAX returns. Currently supported: I64 literals, addition, subtraction,
multiplication, bitwise AND/OR/XOR/complement, negation, and parentheses.

`python3 tools/test-i386.py` compiles nine boundary-value expression cases inside
TempleOS, exports the machine code, audits executable instruction ranges, and
executes them in a separate 32-bit protected-mode BIOS/CHS runner with 8 MiB RAM
under QEMU's 486 model. Cases exercise carry, borrow, cross-word multiplication,
signed negation, complement, and wraparound. Expected values are fixed test
vectors; the host does not evaluate source to generate the target code.
Unsupported floating point, narrowing casts, and division are explicitly rejected.

## Function compilation in progress

`Compiler/I386/Core.HC` is selected by `CCF_TARGET_I386` in the normal compiler
pipeline. `CmpI386Buf` is an experimental cross-compilation entry point. It emits
fixed-arity integer functions, EDX:EAX arithmetic, stack arguments at EBP+8,
local scalar loads/stores, explicit casts, and callee cleanup. Comparisons,
conditional branches, `if`/`while`/`do`/`for`, unary operations, prefix/postfix
increment/decrement, arithmetic/bitwise compound assignments, and 64-bit shifts
are also emitted. `Compiler/I386/Divide.HC` provides a relocatable 32-bit
quotient/remainder template assembled by HolyC and copied into target functions.
Signed division truncates toward zero, including constant powers of two; signed
remainders follow the dividend. Zero divisors and signed quotient overflow raise
processor vector 0. Shift counts are masked modulo 64; signed right shifts extend
the sign and unsigned right shifts insert zero bits. Target-size queries
cover parser member/local layouts, `sizeof`, and pointer arithmetic without
changing the running compiler's object pointers. `Kernel/Types.HH` shares the
numeric unions without requiring the complete architecture-specific kernel header.

The x86-64 bootstrap handles folded integer array bounds/default expressions via
an explicit host-constant path. It produces a host return stub containing the
folded value; target function bytes are never used as host executable code.
Nonconstant host evaluation and `#exe` are unsupported. This is temporary
bootstrap machinery, not the eventual native i386 compiler implementation.

Run `python3 tools/test-rebuild.py` before
`python3 tools/test-i386.py --functions` so the test boots the newly built compiler.
111 function cases pass on QEMU's 486 model with 8 MiB RAM. The runner checks
arguments, returns, stack cleanup, preserved registers, pointer-array and packed
class sizes, pointer indexing/wraparound, narrow integer conversion, signed and
unsigned comparisons, loops, mutation operations, and HolyC lvalue storage
reinterpretation. Shift cases cover counts 0, 31, 32, 63, and 64, constant counts,
and compound assignments. Division cases cover mixed signedness, multiword
quotients/remainders, constant divisors, and compound assignments. Four cases
require vector 0 for zero divisors or signed quotient overflow; the runner checks
the exact fault count. Call cases cover forward/backward references within one
compilation unit, recursion, nested calls, zero/two/three arguments, default
arguments, void and narrow returns, pointer mutation, and full argument-slot
extension. F64 output, unresolved functions, and `#exe` remain rejection cases.
Exported function boundaries separate executable code from AOT alignment padding
during instruction auditing. The runner reports the zero-based case index in
hexadecimal on failure. Function bodies
are exercised; the cases may contain multiple functions in one compilation unit.
Cross-module imports/loading, globals, indirect calls, switch dispatch,
short-circuit/chained comparisons, variadic functions, debug information, and
software F64 are not implemented by this backend.

This remains partial M1/M2 work. There is no i386 module loader, software F64,
full kernel, native i386 compiler, or DolDoc desktop yet. Passing the runner does not prove 386SX/DX support,
low-memory self-hosting, or completion of M1/M2. See `docs/i386-abi.md` for the
working ABI decisions and remaining boundaries.

## Test artifacts

- `build/rebuild-test/`: build ISOs, both exported generations, QEMU commands,
  debug logs, screenshots, and source/binary hash manifest.
- `build/i386-functions-test/`: function corpus, disassembly, ABI runner and logs.
- `build/i386-test/`: compiler ISO, generated expressions, disassembly of code
  ranges, test disk, runner log, and result JSON.

The runner's minimal vector-0 handler abandons an expected failing function and
continues the corpus. It is isolated test instrumentation, not the ported kernel's
exception or task-unwinding implementation.

`tools/guest-run.py` owns each test QEMU process and terminates it on completion
or failure. Its port 0xE9 report/export protocol is test instrumentation, not a
new production OS dependency. The ISO builder's overlays inject guest test files
without modifying production startup files.
